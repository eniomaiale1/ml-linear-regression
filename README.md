HW3: Model Complexity, Overfitting, and Underfitting
• Use the “Linear regression with higher-order terms” URL
• https://data-sorcery.org/2009/06/04/linear-regression-with-higher-order-terms/
• This example will use a data set from NIST.
• https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/lls/data/Filip.shtml
• First obtain a very complex model using “Linear regression with higher-order terms”  “Overfitted Model”
• Then use LASSO to remove the higher-order terms (reduce complexity) gradually  Get a “Robust Model”
• Reduce more higher order-terms (reduce complexity more) to get a polynomial with degree one  “Underfitted Model” or too simple
